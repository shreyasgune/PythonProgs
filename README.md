# Python Programs

My first attempts at writing Python Programs. Followed the 'Learn Python The Hard Way' by Zed Shaw. Amazing resource. Check it out.

## Installation

Installing Python : 

For Windows:
Download Python 2.7.x from [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.11/python-2.7.11.msi). 
Make sure to go to the environment variables and edit the `Path` to include `c:\Python27\bin` 
Getting PIP : Download the PIP installation file [here](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) , then open `cmd/powershell` , 
`cd` into the directory where you have downloaded `get-pip.py` and type `python get-pip.py` 
You're going to use pip to install libraries you wan't to use to do the things you want to do.

For UNIX :
Python's already installed. If you ask me, get a VirtualBox implementation of a UNIX distro and do your programming stuff there. 
Much less headache.

## Usage
To run any python program : `$path\<project_folder> python <program_name>.py` 

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
